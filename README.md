# Deal_Finder
The Deal_Finder was an idea of a one-stop location for online shopping for the customers. The customer requests of products would be served with the best deals for the product as per requirement from various existing e-commerce websites. This idea went through phases of designing - software requirement specifications, design document, prototype designing and finally an empirical study regarding the prototype that was designed. The basic functions designed for the website were:  
1. Customer Registration  
2. Customer Login  
3. Browse by Product  
4. Browse by Category  
5. Bookmark Deal  
6. Buy Product  
  
A medium fedility prototype was designed for the website and use cases were represented using presentations. The empirical study conducted was regarding the dependency of aesthetic score of the prototype, as per the user, on the number of images, size of images, number of text objects and layout of objects.
